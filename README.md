# Sparse-Arrays-ds
This code solves the Sparse Arrays problem by counting how many times each query string appears in the original string list. It first builds a frequency dictionary of all strings in the input list for efficient O(1) lookups. The algorithm then processes each query by retrieving its count from the dictionary, providing quick results even for large datasets.
